# Common services

There are a set of services that should be common across specific silos of services provided by the API.

One such example is Open311 GeoQuery v2, an American orignated standard for creating service requests (report graffiti, report fly-tipping, etc)

Thus, in Waste services we reuse Open311 to cover off a number of service requests from a citizen. These are covered in detail in the README.md in the waste services folder.
